# RL6

In order to start this project you should follow this steps:

1. Create a folder on your computer
2. install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/
3. "Git bash here" in your new folder
4. git clone 'this repo'
5. pip install flask
6. pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
7. pip install flask-login
8. python main.py

The last command should return you something like this:

 Serving Flask app 'website'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 821-623-330

Then you just need to copy this url http://127.0.0.1:5000 and paste it into your browser

That's it! At this point you should be able to test the website.
